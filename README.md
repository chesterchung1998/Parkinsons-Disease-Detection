# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
A simple prediction system that detects whether a patient has Parkinson's disease using machine learning, based on features such as average vocal fundamental frequency, ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice, and signal fractal scaling exponent. This system utilizes the Support Vector Machine theory for classification, and is based on the Parkinson's Disease Dataset in Kaggle. 
- Codes can be found in the Python script named '13_Parkinsons_Disease_Detection.ipynb'.
- Dataset can be found in the Excel file named 'parkinsons.csv'.
